electrocution_fatal	On January 16, 2007, Employee #1 was part of a crew that was replacing a wooden pole with an 80 ft tall steel pole at the rear of a home in Fayetteville, NC. The utility facilities attached to the poles included, from top to bottom, a galvanized steel shield wire, three de-energized and grounded aluminum transmission conductors insulated for 115 kilovolts, three aluminum distribution conductors energized at 12.5/7.2 kilovolts, and an aluminum neutral conductor. In addition, one uninsulated and three insulated galvanized steel guys were attached to the opposite side of the pole behind the shield wire and the transmission and distribution conductors; these were all pulled tightly to anchor rods at ground level. A ground rod had been installed next to the steel pole and connected to it with a short piece of #4 copper wire. The shield wire and transmission conductors had been disconnected from the wood pole and attached to the steel one. The top portion of the wood pole had also been cut off down to the level of the top distribution conductor, which was attached to the steel pole while also still attached to the wood pole. A coworker was using a Lug-All hoist to pull the middle distribution conductor close enough to the steel pole to allow a first-class lineman to attach it to the polymer insulator. During this process, the steel extension link between the steel pole and the insulator inadvertently contacted a steel ring on one end of the metal-bodied hoist. The steel hook on the other end of the hoist was either touching or in close proximity to the energized conductor, resulting in the pole becoming energized. Approximately 10 ft away, on the opposite side of the metal pole from the first-class lineman and working in a separate bucket, was Employee #1, also a first-class lineman. He was using #4 copper wire to bind together all the guys. The copper bonding conductor had been connected to the uninsulated top guy and Employee #1 was preparing to connect it to the next guy.

The company had been contracted to install a swimming pool and spa in Ft Myers, FL. Employee #1 had delivered gunite material, a combination of sand and cement mix, to the location. A four-person team was also at the accident site to spray and shape the gunite as it was dispensed from the gunite truck. The crew was positioned forty to sixty feet away from the truck; they last saw the driver heading toward the truck with a shovel. Although the truck was empty at the time of the accident, the crew's supervisor assumed that the driver was going to the truck to bang the shovel against the sides of the bin. This act would have loosened any sand that had become stuck inside on the wall of the bin. It was often done by drivers, but only from the outside. Minutes later, the supervisor released one of the crew members to see if the driver needed assistance. The truck was empty, and no product was being dispensed by the truck. The crew member arrived at the truck but could not locate the driver. The truck's auger, which was still in operation at this time, made it difficult to hear. The crew member remained at the rear of the truck waiting for the driver. It was at this time that he noticed a piece of clothing being expelled from the auger. He quickly turned the truck off and immediately notified his supervisor. The shovel was found on the top edge of the sand bin undamaged. The supervisor found Employee #1 inside the truck's sand bin, caught in the 9-inch auger located in the bottom of the bin. The supervisor called emergency medical services. The driver was alive when he was extracted from the auger, but he died on the scene while being attended to by emergency responders due to leg amputations. The mobile gunite truck was a 1989 International industrial truck which contained two bins. One bin held sand, and the other held cement mix. The truck had a 9-inch diameter auger, 17 feet, 7 inches in length, which ran through the bottom of both bins. The auger transferred sand from the sand bin to the cement mix bin. The two materials were combined and sent to another auger, the mixing auger, located at the rear of the truck. The mixing auger was located outside the truck bins. It extended 9 feet, 9 inches in the rear of the truck. Although there was a ladder located at the rear of the truck, the only time it was used was when the driver visually inspected the load to ensure that a full load was received when material was being loaded into the truck. The loading area was located at the employer's establishment in Cape Coral, FL. The mobile gunite truck had several warning labels posted on the outside of the truck warning of the dangers of the auger, including serious injury, amputation, and death. The driver had been employed eight months. He had received guidelines and training on driver responsibilities on November 20, 2009.

They were working on a new above-ground primary cabinet (PME). The crew was "cutting over" the new "A" phase load to the new PME #6058 and verifying that they were energizing the proper new "A" phase cable and that it was properly terminated, tagged, and mapped. They were "phoning out" the conductor by connecting a battery-operated walkie-talkie device to each end of the selected cable and verifying verbally with the persons at each end that they were connected through the same cable. This was necessary because workers at the two ends were not in view of one another. The crew first opened the down circuit structure (#B5143734) and identified the new cable. They then proceeded to set up the tools and equipment to connect the phone there. Employees #1 and #2 proceeded to the PME #6058 to connect to the opposite end of the "A" phase cable to phone back to the circuit side.

fall_nonfatal	At approximately 10:27 a.m. on February 27, 2014, Employee #1, a carpenter employed by a construction framing company, was working on a scaffold platform at a multifamily construction project. He was nailing a wood block on an exterior wall while sitting on the fourth level of the scaffold platform, which was approximately 28 feet above the ground. Upon completing his task, he attempted to stand up by holding onto a midrail attached to the scaffold frame on his right side. One end of the midrail detached from the scaffold frame, and Employee #1 fell off the platform and to the ground, a fall height of approximately 29 to 30 feet. Emergency services were called, and Employee #1 was transported to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. He was admitted and treated for bruises/contusions/abrasions to his back. This incident was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer at approximately 4:30 p.m. on February 27, 2014. During the subsequent investigation, it was established that the employer was one of multiple subcontractors at the worksite. Employee #1 stated that he was an experienced carpenter and well trained in work safety, but not trained to do safety inspection of the scaffolds. Employee #1 stated that he recalled seeing the fastener/latch of the midrail open as he was standing up, and the midrail came off easily in his hand, without his exerting any effort. Then he struggled to hold onto something, but because he was leaning toward his right side, he lost his balance and fell. The investigation determined that the scaffold was erected by one of the other subcontractors, Northstate Plastering, Inc. The foreman/supervisor of Northstate Plastering, when interviewed, stated that he was responsible for the scaffold inspections, but he did not inspect the scaffolds on February 27, 2014. He stated that he had erected this scaffold. He had secured one end of the mid-rail by tying it to other scaffold members with a metal wire. He fastened/latched the other end of the midrail on a lock pin, which is part of the scaffold frame. Photographs taken by the Santa Clara Fire Department showed that every midrail, including the midrail involved in this incident, was tied up with a wire from one end only. As stated by the Northstate Plastering foreman/supervisor, the other end of the midrail in question was fastened/latched to a lock pin along with two other scaffold members. The Northstate Plastering foreman/supervisor stated that it was common practice to fasten/latch three ends of different scaffold members (cross-braces and midrails) onto one lock pin. However, the scaffold manufacturer, A1 Plank & Scaffold Mfg., Inc., was contacted and asked if three scaffold members can be latched safely onto one lock pin, and the manufacturer stated, "The securing of x-braces and rails on the same lock pin will only allow you to 2 (scaffold members). The reason for this is if you get more on there than 2, the force and pressure of having a third one on there could cause the outside one to pop off and could become a safety issue." The investigation determined that the midrail in question was the third scaffold-member on the lock pin. According to the project's general contractor, after Employee #1's fall, the scaffold was inspected and the set-up of the scaffold members was changed. Only two scaffold members were fastened on one lock pin, and an additional midrail was installed for better security. The investigation concluded that, based on the statements and observation, the exposing employer, that is, Employee #1's employer, and the creating/correcting/controlling employer, Northstate Plastering, Inc., did not ensure that the scaffold's midrail was secured before exposing Employee #1 and other employees to the hazards of working on the scaffold. At the time of this report, both subcontractors were to be cited for a serious violation of T8 CCR 1644(a)(6). In addition, Northstate Plastering was to be cited under T8 CCR 1509(a) for not effectively implementing th

caught_fatal	On December 28, 2010, Employee #1, a 60-year-old Caucasian male who had worked for over 20 years as a truck driver and service technician at a propane delivery company in Eagle River, WI, was delivering propane. He was a replacement for the regular driver, who had taken two days of vacation. Employee #1 had driven the same truck the previous day, without incident, and had delivered (in a different vehicle) to this customer previously. Therefore, he was somewhat familiar with the site. According to the Sheriff's department accident recreation, Employee #1 arrived at the property between 8:00 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., for an automatic delivery (no notification to the home owner). This was the first delivery scheduled for the day, and therefore, the truck was fully loaded. Employee #1 backed the truck up the driveway, which was sloped by approximately 30 degrees. He then moved forward approximately ten feet and applied the air brake and parking brake. Employee #1 then unrolled the delivery hose and walked around snow banks and rocks to the customer's receiving tank, adjacent to the house/garage, to begin filling. The driver unit was equipped with a remote pump control, which allowed the driver to stay at the tank area, watch the tank fill indicator, and shut off gas flow without returning to the truck. The air brakes were engaged and chocks were placed per company policy. Heavy snow covered the driveway area. As noted from deeply embedded tire tracks in the heavy snow cover on the driveway area, the truck began slipping down the hill at some point during the fill, with one back wheel in a fixed position and the other turning normally. The delivery hose was still attached but totally splayed out, which may have contributed to the slanted path of the truck. Employee #1 left footprints in the snow that showed he ran after the truck, while it was slipping downhill. He caught up with it and had reached inside to open the door and get into the cab, when the truck struck the garage at the base of the hill. The truck stopped after striking the garage face, at a distance of 85 feet from the start point. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Employee #1 was killed when crushed between the truck door and truck cab, as the sliding truck struck the garage structure. Cause of death was determined to be a crushing injury to the chest and mechanical asphyxiation. No one witnessed the accident. At 11:38 a.m., the home owner went outside, without knowing that a delivery was in progress. He observed the hose and truck in an unusual position, and when he investigated, he found Employee #1's body still trapped in the truck, between the frame and door. The engine and propane gas pump were still running. A witness assisting the homeowner entered on the passenger side and turned off the pump. The site tank was overfilled, but an over pressure safety device in the mechanism shunted propane back to the truck tank during the continuous overfill and prevented a potential leak and explosion. The regular driver stated that the truck had slipped on the snow/ice covering this driveway during previous deliveries. He explained that in warmer days following heavy snowfall, the truck tires carried heat from road friction and gradually melted packed snow to create an icy track, while the truck was parked. The truck was designed so that it carried a lot of weight forward. The homeowner stated that he had a flat area cleared lateral to the driveway, for the propane truck to park during deliveries, per driver request. However, the area was not used during this delivery. A space on the delivery ticket for additional comments, e.g., safety precautions, only had directions to the location. The truck involved in the accident was a 2001 Freightliner bobtail with three axles, 3,500-gallon propane capacity, and cab-over-axle design. Mechanical and pumping equipment were extensively refitted when the truck was transferred from the Minnesota facility to the current location in March 2010. The

electrocution_fatal	On August 3, 2002, Employee #1 was hired as a subcontractor to perform plumbing work at a residence in Los Angeles, CA. At approximately 10:00 a.m., he and a coworker arrived at the house; the coworker went inside and Employee #1 prepared to began to work underneath it. His job required that he access fresh water plumbing via a crawl space that was entered through an opening at the back of the residence. He continued to work until about 7:30 p.m., when he called the contractor to request he purchase an additional part from Home Depot before it closed. The contractor arrived at the site around 8:00 p.m. to get some of the supply money he had given Employee #1. He then left and returned with the part at approximately 9:00 p.m. Employee #1 continued working, but at approximately 10:00 p.m. he complained to the contractor that the house was not grounded and that he was getting shocked. The contractor asked him to come out of the crawl space, but Employee #1 responded that he could see where it was that he was getting shocked, although he did not specify the area. Within a short time, Employee #1 was shocked a second time, with enough intensity that it caused him to bite his tongue. The contractor again urged him to come out, and he then went into the house to call the property owner. At this time the coworker who had been inside the residence came out to see what was happening. The contractor was speaking with the owner when the coworker returned to the house and told him that Employee #1 was not moving. The contractor ended the call and contacted Emergency Services, who instructed him to shut off the power to the house. Employee #1 was transported by paramedics to the Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was pronounced dead. The Los Angeles County Coroner's report indicated that the cause of death was consistent with electrocution. On September 24, 2002, an interview was conducted with the electrician who did electrical work on the property after the accident. He stated that the electrical system of the house was not grounded. The service supplying power to the house, which was fed from the meter box of a neighboring residence, was comprised of two energized lines and a neutral line, but no ground wire. Also, no grounding stake was found installed at the house. Underneath the house he found an approximately 10 ft long run of 3/8 in. flexible conduit (BX cable) that contained 18-gauge hot and neutral wires that were not terminated. The hot wire in this conduit was energized and found to be drawing current from a duplex receptacle in the kitchen. The conduit itself was cut off and the wires inside frayed, making contact with the conduit possible. This flexible metal conduit, whihc was not grounded, had been run through the floor and stapled to the floor joists approximately 2 ft from the newly installed copper plumbing. A grocery bag was also found tied around the conduit, holding up some Romex wiring. Arc spots on the conduit suggest it was probably the source of contact for Employee #1. Neither he nor the contractor held electrical contractor licenses.

electrocution_nonfatal	At approximately 9:00 a.m. on February 1, 2010, Employee #1 was assisting in the construction of a micropile system a large municipal office building. At the time of the accident, a large, split-level excavation had had been dug for the building foundation. The employer was in the process of drilling a series of 68-foot deep holes into the floor of the excavation for micropiles. The employer had positioned two micropile rigs into the deeper portion of the split-level excavation: one yellow rig and one red rig. The employer had also placed a 900 cfm/300 psi air compressor on the lip of the upper portion of the excavation. Both rigs were to be hooked up to the air compressor so that the compressor could supply the rigs with compressed air to blow excavated sand and soil out of the micropile holes during the drilling process. At the time of the accident, a fifty-foot, two-inch-diameter hose was connected to the compressor and extended down the slope of the excavation to the lower level, near to where the rigs were located. At the end of the fifty-foot hose, there was a T-shaped manifold connected with dual outlets - one outlet at the end of the manifold, in line with the supply hose (the "in-line valve"), and the other branching out perpendicularly to the right (the "secondary valve"). Each of the two outlets was equipped with a quarter-turn ball valve, and each valve had a lever attached to the top of the manifold to allow a user to open or close the valve. At the time of the accident, the yellow micropile rig was already connected to the air compressor via a hose attached to the open in-line valve on the manifold. The air compressor was pumping air into the hose, and the yellow rig was operating. To place the red micropile rig into operation, the employer tasked Coworker #1 Coworker #2 to connect the red micropile rig to the air compressor through a hose attached to the secondary valve. Coworkers #1 and #2 determined that the hose they planned to use to connect the red micropile rig to the manifold would not reach from the rig to the manifold, so they decided to reposition the manifold closer to the red rig. Coworker #2 grasped the live air hose on the supply side of the manifold to drag the manifold across the ground and into position. Almost immediately after Coworker #2 began to pull the supply hose, the manifold turned over, either onto its side or upside down, so that the valve levers on top of the manifold were in contact with the ground. The lever for the secondary valve, which was in the closed position when Coworker #2 began to drag the manifold, caught against the ground or another obstruction and rotated into an open, or at least semi-open, position. As the compressed air began to rush out of the opened secondary valve, the manifold and supply line lifted off the ground and began to whip about. Employee #1, who was not involved in hooking up the red micropile rig, was struck in the leg and knocked to the ground. The manifold, still energized with compressed air, continued to flail and struck Coworker #1 in the chest. Coworker #1 grabbed the manifold and held it against his chest, was lofted momentarily into the air, and then knocked to the ground. Coworker #1 was on the ground, still clutching the manifold to his chest, when Coworker #2 threw himself onto Coworker #1 to help arrest the whipping of the manifold. Shortly thereafter, another coworker was able to shut the compressor off, deenergizing the manifold and air hose. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was admitted and remained over 24 hours for treatment of a fractured leg. The San Francisco Fire Department reported the incident at 11:00 a.m. the same day. The employer, Dees-Hennessey, Inc. reported the accident the next day at 9:00 a.m. The employer is a foundation/site- preparation contractor, and had been engaged by the general contractor of the new office building.

When he ran out of argon, Employee #1 asked a coworker if he could use the electrical Lincoln two-arc welding machine (Model Number AC-225). The coworker apparently informed Employee #1 that they did not use the welding machine, because it did not work right, but the employees began to search for welding leads. Employee #1 used the Lincoln welding machine to complete the welds to the bracket and then showed his coworker that the welding machine did work, before he proceeded to complete the task. Employee #1 placed and welded the bracket which was located under the frame on the driver's side, approximately 32 inches from the outside frame, in a very awkward position for welding. Employee #1 proceeded to use the Lincoln welding machine to complete the welds on the bottom of the C-channel bracket. An interviewed coworker heard a shout and ran to Employee #1, who was approximately 15 feet to 20 feet away. The coworker found Employee #1 on the ground, lying on his right side. Employee #1 was killed. The coworker went on to mention that Employee #1 had his back turned away, and he could not tell if Employee #1 had the stinger in his hand. At the scene, the CSHO (Compliance Safety and Health Officer) noted that the welding machine was in the "on" position (disconnected) and the welding rod was still in the stinger. The investigation concluded that Employee #1 was possibly electrocuted, until otherwise ruled by the Medical Examiner's office. Evidence for the conclusion included welding leads with several exposed areas on the stinger and the ground ends, a broken ground clamp, and very dry-rotted and cracked ground leads. There was also a possibility that the DC (direct current) electrical welding machine was connected to the 220-volt AC (alternating current) metal quad box on the ground, apparently with a flexible extension cord.

struck_nonfatal	At 9:30 a.m. on March 12, 2014, Employee #1, employed by a structural engineering construction company herein designated Employer #1, was working as a lead laborer at a project where the employer had been subcontracted for construction of a swimming pool. Coworker #1, employed by Employer #2, another construction subcontractor at the site, was operating a Caterpillar Model 330DL with a 4-cubic yard bucket capacity excavator. This excavator was being used to dig the swimming pool. The site foreman was elsewhere on the site. As part of the excavation process, on the previous day, March 11, 2014, a 4,850-pound, 48-foot long waler (horizontal steel shoring member) had been placed in position and rested onto "chairs" (supporting brackets on a column for the waler) approximately 7 feet high. Two clamps were installed onto each of the "chairs" of the two columns to prevent the waler from moving/sliding. The waler was later determined to be on the wrong side of the excavation. The waler had to be removed from the west side of the excavation and placed onto the east side. Before this action could occur, the four clamps had to be taken off of the "chairs." On March 12, 2014, Employee #1 was on the bottom of the excavation making preparations to remove the clamps. Coworker #1, operating the excavator, pulled the waler off of the "chairs." The waler landed on Employee #1. Emergency services were called, and the San Francisco Fire Department responded.

This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Francisco Fire Department on March 12, 2014. Cal/OSHA sent two engineers, who began their investigation on March 12, 2014. During the course of the investigation, interviews were conducted with the project superintendent, the safety director, Employee #1, and Coworker #1. No citation for a serious accident-related violation was issued to Employee #1's employer, because Employee #1 had not known that the excavator was to be operated and moved. However, Employer #2, the subcontractor whose employee was operating the excavator, was cited a serious accident-related violation as the creating employer. T8 CCR '1616.1 (o) requires that during lifting, there shall not be contact with obstructions. The operator swung (lifted) his boom to get another load of dirt. He did not realize that the slings were still attached to the waler. When he swung the boom, it pulled the waler off of the "chairs," and the waler landed on Employee #1. No other violations were cited.

electrocution_nonfatal	On August 21, 2003, an employee was trimming copper cable with a saw on the "A" side of the Oak Ridge Mall on the second floor mezzanine in the electrical room. The employee indicated that he had looked for cable cutters, but was told they were being used by another crew. He then located a portable band saw and began to use that. The employee stated that he asked his foreman for the portable band saw. He was kneeling/squatting on the ground wit his right knee up and his left knee on the ground. He stated that he would jam the cable against the panel frame. The portable band saw repeatedly jammed and the employee indicated the reason for this was because the blade was thin and would bind against the multiple strands in the cable. At one point, while freeing a cable, the saw began to fall to the ground and landed on his finger. Since his other hand was still on the band saw with his finger on the trigger, the blade was activated and amputated part of his index finger. He was hospitalized and had surgery the following day to amputate most of his index finger at Kaiser Hospital. The foreman stated that he didn't remember seeing wire cutters or pliers when cleaning up after the employee's accident. He also stated that he didn't remember discussing the lack of wire cutters with the employee. The employee's apprentice stated that he helped cut the cables the day prior to the accident and on the day of the accident. He also stated that the cables were secured prior to cutting them. In the first interview, the employee stated that this piece of equipment was suitable for this task. In a later interview, he recanted this statement and said that it was not the right piece of equipment to use. It was determined that the portable band saw was being used in a manner that was unsafe. In addition, the wires that were being cut were not secured or supported to minimize blade binding, kick-back or jamming. Pliers are able to cut the same size cables safely when cable cutters are not available.

Employee #1 had been working near two ducts when a coworker spotted him lying on a pile of metal conduit in front of the ducts. Several other coworkers approached when they realized that he was unconscious and did not have a pulse. Two coworkers attempted CPR until paramedics arrived, but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful; Employee #1 was declared dead at 3:03 p.m. The 4 ft wide ducts Employee #1 was working near were a foot apart and on top of a concrete pad that extended through the roof of the building. The installation work appeared to be finished on the front, back, and outside of the ducts. The installation inside, between the ducts, was not yet done. Two pieces of insulation were partially attached to the rear corners. The area in front of the duct was 6 ft 5 in. wide and had piles of metal conduit. The welding machine's ground cable, a "C" clamp, was attached to the duct access panel lock. The machine was set for straight polarity and 80 volts. Evidence found during the investigation suggested that the machine arced near the magnetic chuck, shaft, and nut on the "C" clamp, and that Employee #1 was electrocuted. It was also noted that he was not wearing gloves or similar protective equipment.

electrocution_fatal	At approximately 9:15 a.m. on April 25, 2013, Employee #1, #2, and #3 were preparing for a scheduled test of a motor controller (MC) starter system in the control building of a water supply deep well and reservoir facility. The MC was a Series 81000 motor controller manufactured by Siemens Industry Inc. that would serve a 600 hp submersible pump, operating on 3-phase, 4,160 volt electric power. The pump was to be installed in the well at the site. Employee #1 was a senior engineer working for the Siemens. He was the primary designer of the Series 81000 and had 20 years of experience with similar equipment. Employee #2 was a design engineer for Phasetronics LLC, which manufactured a motor starter that was incorporated in the Siemens motor controller starter system. Employee #3 was the sole proprietor of Scada & Control Systems LLC, which had purchased and provided the electronic and control systems equipment for the deep well and reservoir facility. Employee #1 and #2 arrived at the facility with Employee #3 earlier in the week to troubleshoot and repair the MC starter system, which had failed during initial testing in August 2012. The MC system was in a metal cabinet in one of two banks of cabinets that faced each other 6.58 ft apart inside the control building. The door of the MC cabinet was approximately 90 in. high and 36 in. wide. The interior of the cabinet was divided into three physically separate compartments from top to bottom with the 120 volt MC system control panel in the middle compartment. The bottom compartment contained various wiring, leads for the three phases of the pump motor and a movable carriage that held contactors, fuses and other circuit parts for the pump motor and the MC control panel. The carriage was 18 in. wide. It fit on a track on the right side of the bottom compartment and occupied slightly over half of the compartment's 35 in. interior width. It was racked (moved forward or back) by a lever next to the cabinet door on the lower right side. At its rearmost position, the contactors engaged the main busbar and energized the system at 4,160 volts. This was stepped down to 120 volts for the control panel. An interlock inside the cabinet was designed to accept a tab on the cabinet door so that the lever could not be moved to rack the contactors if the door were open. With the carriage removed from the cabinet and the system de-energized, Employee #1 installed a monitoring instrument behind the control panel and attached a cable from it to one of the motor leads at the left rear of the bottom section. He and Employee #3 then placed the contactor carriage back on its track. Employee #1 knelt on the concrete floor in front of the open cabinet and used a screwdriver to defeat the interlock. He told Employee #3 to slowly raise the lever to rack the contactor (which would engage the busbar) while he watched to see that the carriage did not pinch the instrument cable. Employee #2 stood a few feet away by the opposite bank of cabinets preparing a laptop computer to monitor the system test. None of them was wearing any form of electrical protective equipment, such as insulated gloves or gauntlets, face shield, or flame resistant clothing. After the contactor was racked, which energized the exposed parts on the carriage at 4,160 volts, Employee #1 said the cable "looked okay." As Employee #2 and #3 turned away, Employee #1 reached with his left arm into the cabinet and his forearm contacted one of the energized parts on the carriage. Employee #3 saw Employee #1's body shaking and tried to pull him away from the cabinet while he threw the lever to rack out the contactor. In the process, he received an electric shock. Employee #2 was also shocked when his left arm touched the open cabinet door as he also tried to pull Employee #1 away. Employee #2 threw the main breaker for the building, which was roughly 12 ft to the left of the MC cabinet. He and Employee #3 pulled Employee #1 out of the cabinet and onto hi

struck_fatal	At approximately 1:53 to 1:55 p.m. on January 31, 2014, Employee #1, part of a six-worker crew employed by Erosion Control Landscape Services Inc., was working at the 16.5-mile marker on the inner loop of Interstate 695 (Baltimore Beltway), just past a set of exit-entrance ramps. The land along the inner loop of the highway had been cleared by another contractor in preparation for widening the lanes and building a new bridge over a local road. The employer had been hired by the State of Maryland's State Highway Administration to shoot out grass seed over the cleared areas and then cover the grass seed with straw/hay. This was being done for erosion control prior to the start of the actual construction work. The employer had one large truck on site with a Finn B-260 Straw Blower attached to it. The truck with straw blower was on the extreme right side of the shoulder next to the guardrail. There was enough room for the workers to open the passenger door of the truck so they could get in and out when needed. The crew members had finished their work for the day and were in the process of getting all of their materials and equipment together, because they were supposed to be off of the shoulder by approximately 2:00 p.m. at the latest. This is a requirement for all construction vehicles on the Beltway on Fridays. Numerous orange warning cones had been put in place, closing the shoulder for at least .5 mile in advance of the work area. A number of large work signs had been erected to indicate that work was taking place ahead. It was a clear, sunny day and not particularly cold for the end of January. A private citizen driving a small white 2001 Ford pickup truck with a snowplow blade attached to the front was driving in the slow lane next to the shoulder. For unknown reason the pickup truck drifted to the right, out of the slow lane and onto the shoulder, where it ran over two or three of the warning cones. It then clipped the rear left end of the straw-blowing machine and caused the rear tire to flatten. Employee #1, who was wearing a bright day-glow greenish yellow safety vest, was standing and working behind the employer's large truck and in front of the straw blowing machine. The straw blower was not in operation. The pickup truck struck the employee with enough force that it threw him into the side of the large truck and then approximately 26 feet 6 inches forward and out into the slow lane of the Beltway, where he landed. According to the subsequent investigation, Employee #1, when he landed in the highway, probably already was dead from the massive injuries he suffered. No other vehicles struck him. The pickup truck then sideswiped the employer's large truck on the driver's side. The pickup truck traveled a short distance down the highway before the driver pulled over and stopped on the shoulder. This fatal event was investigated by Maryland OSHA. Its subsequent investigative report contained a statement from the Area Engineer for State Highways that the employer had set up properly, and there were no issues with the set-up, the workers, or the work being done. A statement from the Maryland State Trooper in charge of the police investigation indicated that this was a traffic work zone accident caused by the driver of the white Ford pickup truck. The Medical Examiner's report indicated that this was a traffic accident caused by the driver of the white pickup truck. All findings indicated that the employer's vehicle and blower attachment had been set up correctly with warning cones and signs in place. Therefore, no citations were to be issued to the employer.

electrocution_fatal	On July 28, 2005, Employee #1, a versatile employee who did various jobs of Emerson Trailers, Incorporated, was welding trailer gates. He was welding using a Wire Feed, Arc Welding Machine. Employee #2 was in the room, but did not observe what happened. He stated he heard Employee #1 cry out. When he turned around, Employee #1 was on the floor. Other coworkers ran to see what happened and two coworkers started administering CPR. Emergency services arrived, took over CPR, and transported Employee #1 to the hospital, where he later died. An investigation into the incident found that the welding machine was in the "on" position, and that the 50 Amp electrical breaker, which served the circuit to the welding machine, had been tripped. It was noted that Employee #1 did not have his welding hood on. He did have his work gloves on, but the welding gun was not in his hand. The OSHA investigation revealed that the electrical conductors (2 hot and 1 neutral), inside of the male attachment plug for the welding machine, were not securely connected to their terminal points. The visible evidence of burns inside of the attachment plug and the melting of the individual strands of the neutral conductor indicated that the neutral conductor came out of its terminal point inside of the attachment plug and it made contact with a hot (energized) wire that was also inside of the attachment plug. This contact allowed current to flow through the neutral conductor and back down to the equipment grounding attachment location, which was on the metal frame inside of the welding machine. The frame of the welding machine became energized and so did any metal parts of the welding machine that were in contact with the metal frame. The welding machine was sitting on the floor next to a tin wall, when the incident occurred. There were two electrical burn marks on the tin wall, which matched up perfectly with two electrical burn marks that were on the side of the welding machine which was facing towards the tin wall. It was believed that Employee #1 made contact with the energized welding machine and he received an initial electrical shock. He either fell against the welding machine, causing it to hit the tin wall or both Employee #1 and the welding machine hit the tin wall. When the energized welding machine made contact with the tin wall an, electrical short circuit would have been created that would be sufficient to cause the fifty (50) Amp circuit breaker to trip out.

electrocution_fatal	On August 3, 2002, Employee #1 was hired as a subcontractor to perform plumbing work at a residence in Los Angeles, CA. At approximately 10:00 a.m., he and a coworker arrived at the house; the coworker went inside and Employee #1 prepared to began to work underneath it. His job required that he access fresh water plumbing via a crawl space that was entered through an opening at the back of the residence. He continued to work until about 7:30 p.m., when he called the contractor to request he purchase an additional part from Home Depot before it closed. The contractor arrived at the site around 8:00 p.m. to get some of the supply money he had given Employee #1. He then left and returned with the part at approximately 9:00 p.m. Employee #1 continued working, but at approximately 10:00 p.m. he complained to the contractor that the house was not grounded and that he was getting shocked. The contractor asked him to come out of the crawl space, but Employee #1 responded that he could see where it was that he was getting shocked, although he did not specify the area. Within a short time, Employee #1 was shocked a second time, with enough intensity that it caused him to bite his tongue. The contractor again urged him to come out, and he then went into the house to call the property owner. At this time the coworker who had been inside the residence came out to see what was happening. The contractor was speaking with the owner when the coworker returned to the house and told him that Employee #1 was not moving. The contractor ended the call and contacted Emergency Services, who instructed him to shut off the power to the house. Employee #1 was transported by paramedics to the Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was pronounced dead. The Los Angeles County Coroner's report indicated that the cause of death was consistent with electrocution. On September 24, 2002, an interview was conducted with the electrician who did electrical work on the property after the accident. He stated that the electrical system of the house was not grounded. The service supplying power to the house, which was fed from the meter box of a neighboring residence, was comprised of two energized lines and a neutral line, but no ground wire. Also, no grounding stake was found installed at the house. Underneath the house he found an approximately 10 ft long run of 3/8 in. flexible conduit (BX cable) that contained 18-gauge hot and neutral wires that were not terminated. The hot wire in this conduit was energized and found to be drawing current from a duplex receptacle in the kitchen. The conduit itself was cut off and the wires inside frayed, making contact with the conduit possible. This flexible metal conduit, whihc was not grounded, had been run through the floor and stapled to the floor joists approximately 2 ft from the newly installed copper plumbing. A grocery bag was also found tied around the conduit, holding up some Romex wiring. Arc spots on the conduit suggest it was probably the source of contact for Employee #1. Neither he nor the contractor held electrical contractor licenses.

struck_fatal	At 5:30 p.m. on December 8, 2015, two employees were ascending on a swing-stage scaffold to inspect the I-beam supporting the scaffold system.  The Company's Sa fety Manager asked the employees to ascend on the swing-stage scaffold to inspec t and adjust the I-beam supporting the scaffold system. The Safety Manager made the request after they attempted to move the swing-stage scaffold from the groun d and one of the I-beam trolleys being used to support the scaffold system and l ifelines became stuck.   The I-beam supporting the swing-stage scaffold was part of a High Bay Pallet Storage (HBPS) system upper guide rail. The upper guide ra il supporting the swing-stage scaffold was designed to keep the HBPS system cran e plumbed during operation and not designed as a load bearing I-beam. The upper rail was approximately 76 feet, 9 inches above ground level and consisted of six teen I-beam sections. Trolley anchors were used to connect the Spider swing-stag e scaffold system to the I-beam. The upper guide rail I-beam was connected and s upported by cross aisle ties (CATs). It was established during the investigation , the weight of the scaffold system and the I-beam exceeded the CAT's maximum in tended load capacity. At the time of the accident, the upper guide rail (I-beam) sections were not connected and had visible gaps between the rail joints. The S afety Manager and scaffold competent person did not perform a visual inspection of the upper guide rail prior to using the scaffold. The rail sections gap incre ased as a result of the CAT deflection due to the imposed load. The gaps allowed three (3) I-beam rollers to roll off the I-beam causing the employee to fall ap proximately 40 feet to the next lower level. The employee received multiple inte rnal injuries resulting from a forty (40) foot fall and being struck by the swin g-stage scaffold which also fell from a height of approximately forty (40) feet, and was killed.  The employee was fatally injured when a Spider swing-stage sca ffold fell approximately 40 feet to the next lower level.

According to Employee #1 and his foreman, they were repositioning the screed, a 14 foot (4.3 meter) Razorback concrete truss screed) when the accident occurred. The foreman was position at one end of the screed or machine, operating it. He called to Employee #1 to help him move the machine a couple inches (a few centimeters). Employee #1 grabbed the winch reel or winch frame while the foreman raised himself from his operator position. As they were moving the machine, the winch started moving. Employee #'1s finger was caught between the winch reel and the frame he was holding onto. The finger was amputated, either at the scene or later. The narrative did not state whether the amputation was accomplished in a surgical setting or which finger was amputated. Neither employee was sure how the winch became activated. The employer stated that the hydraulic winch was constantly pressurized as long as the machine was running or in service. The workers powered the machine and winch from a separate piece of equipment, such as a Bobcat, which was used as an external hydraulic pump. The only way to completely deenergize the machine was to disconnect the hydraulic hoses, which the workers would only do when they were finished using the machine. The winch was operated by a large toggle switch at the operator's position at the end of the machine. It was used to pull the machine forward as it vibrated and smoothed the polyurethane-treated concrete. From information gained in the employer's accident investigation, the employer believed that the foreman must have leaned forward into the switch, activating the winch. According to the employer and the foreman, both the foreman and Employee #1 were experienced with and trained to use the screed. Employee #1, though, stated he did not use that equipment and was not trained to use it. He further stated that he did receive training on the equipment he did use and before the start of every new job. The Division was not provided with any equipment-specific procedures or training. The employer had an injury and illness prevention program (I2P2) containing the required elements. The employer, however, had failed to follow through with at least three sections, including training (documentation), job hazard analysis (documentation), and accident investigation.

electrocution_nonfatal	At or about or about 9:22 (a.m. or p.m. was not specified) on May 26, 2006, three employees, employed by Metals Etc, Inc., were panel that were in close proximity of the energized buss bars within the electrical panel. The employees cut the six wires using a metal housed, claw type metal shearer, a cutting tool that utilized both hydraulic pressure and 220 volts of electricity for cutting power. The metal shearer weighed 40 pounds and was approximately 2 feet in length. One employee was standing on a 6 foot fiberglass ladder in front of the electrical panel to cut the copper wires, while the second employee was standing in between, and to the side of the electrical panel and the ladder, with both of his arms stretched upwards to support the front of the 40 pound metal shearer six copper wires and either made inadvertent contact with the energized buss bars or, the claws of the shearer were in such close proximity to the energized buss bars that it caused an electrical explosion. Although it was determined, the six copper wires that they were cutting, were not energized, the buss bars within the electrical panel were energized with 440 volts. The Safety Supervisor of the of the two laborers stated that he had a conversation with another company's employee the day before the accident happened at the job site. He stated that the electrical power was cut off within the electrical panel. The employee of the other company denied making that statement. Working under the assumption that the panel was not energized, the Safety Administrator instructed his employees to cut the six copper wires. The Safety Administrator of the two injured employees also stated that he did not test the panel to determine if the panel was energized or not energized, nor did he instruct his employees to test the panel to determine if the panel was energized, or not energized, prior to commencing work and instructing his employees to cut the wires that were in the electrical panel. As a result of the electrical explosion, both laborers received 2nd and 3rd degree burns to their face, neck, chest and arms of their bodies. The Safety Administrator also received splatter burns to his face and arms. After the accident, emergency medical assistance was called. The fire fighters and paramedics arrived shortly after the call. The injured laborers were stabilized and transported by the paramedics to County USC Medical Center Hospital, where they were admitted for days and transferred to Grossmans Burn Center for further treatment. Conclusions: As a result of the investigation, the following conclusions were arrived at: 1) two of the employees working as laborers, were not properly trained to work in electrical panels. 2) The electrical panel was not tested, prior to performing work to determine if it was energized or not energized. 3) The electrical panel was not locked by positive methods or procedures to prevent the unexpected or inadvertent energizing of equipment or appliance. 4) The casual factor leading to the accident was the fact that the metal cutting shearers made inadvertent contact with the buss bars or that they were so close to the buss bars that caused and electrical arc.

electrocution_fatal	On January 16, 2007, Employee #1 was part of a crew that was replacing a wooden pole with an 80 ft tall steel pole at the rear of a home in Fayetteville, NC. The utility facilities attached to the poles included, from top to bottom, a galvanized steel shield wire, three de-energized and grounded aluminum transmission conductors insulated for 115 kilovolts, three aluminum distribution conductors energized at 12.5/7.2 kilovolts, and an aluminum neutral conductor. In addition, one uninsulated and three insulated galvanized steel guys were attached to the opposite side of the pole behind the shield wire and the transmission and distribution conductors; these were all pulled tightly to anchor rods at ground level. A ground rod had been installed next to the steel pole and connected to it with a short piece of #4 copper wire. The shield wire and transmission conductors had been disconnected from the wood pole and attached to the steel one. The top portion of the wood pole had also been cut off down to the level of the top distribution conductor, which was attached to the steel pole while also still attached to the wood pole. A coworker was using a Lug-All hoist to pull the middle distribution conductor close enough to the steel pole to allow a first-class lineman to attach it to the polymer insulator. During this process, the steel extension link between the steel pole and the insulator inadvertently contacted a steel ring on one end of the metal-bodied hoist. The steel hook on the other end of the hoist was either touching or in close proximity to the energized conductor, resulting in the pole becoming energized. Approximately 10 ft away, on the opposite side of the metal pole from the first-class lineman and working in a separate bucket, was Employee #1, also a first-class lineman. He was using #4 copper wire to bind together all the guys. The copper bonding conductor had been connected to the uninsulated top guy and Employee #1 was preparing to connect it to the next guy. When the pole and uninsulated guy became energized, so did the copper bonding conductor. This created a difference of potential between the copper bonding conductor and the insulated guy. Employee #1 was not wearing rubber gloves and he was electrocuted when he contacted both the energized bonding conductor and the insulated guy.

fall_nonfatal	At 8:45 a.m. on January 30, 2017, a truck driver delivered a JLG Telehandler to a rental company. The JLG was on a step-deck trailer. A step-deck trailer has an upper deck on the front of the trailer then steps down to a lower level which a llows multiple loads of cargo. The forks on the telehandler were folded under, a nd work-light support brackets located on the left and right side of the telehan dler so the machine could be as far forward as possible against the step. The dr iver backed the rear of his trailer against the offloading platform located in t he yard. The off-loading/loading ramp was a twenty five foot triangle shaped ram p with expanded metal on the ramp for traction. On the upper left and right side of the ramp were two chains that attached to the trailer of the truck to preven t a gap from occurring between the trunk and ramp. The driver put on his hard ha t and exited the truck cab in order to remove the chains and binders holding the piece of equipment on the trailer. An employee of the rental company told the t ruck driver to say out of the way as he backed the machine off the trailer. The rental company employee got into the JLG Telehandler to back it off the trailer. The JLG Telehandler operator sits on the left side and the operator's view is p artially obstructed by the boom and engine. The JLG telehandler is slightly smal ler in width than the ramp so the rental company employee was carefully watching his placement on the ramp as he was backing up. Once the rear wheels of the mac hine were on the ground the carriage was dragging the ground so the rental compa ny employee raised the carriage just enough to keep it from dragging. At this ti me, the machine engaged its auto-leveling system. The auto-leveling system on bo ard the equipment self-adjusts to keep the carriage and the forks in a flat posi tion. When this system operated, the forks, which were still tucked under the wo rk-lights, rose upward slightly and put pressure on the bottom of the work light s. As a result, the pressure on the work-lights caused the lights to be sheared off the brackets and flung into the air. The truck driver was standing on the pa ssenger side of the trailer about half way down and was struck in the face with the lights. The rental company employee who was operating the JLG Telehandler sa w the truck driver fall off the loading dock.

electrocution_fatal	At approximately 9:15 a.m. on April 25, 2013, Employee #1, #2, and #3 were preparing for a scheduled test of a motor controller (MC) starter system in the control building of a water supply deep well and reservoir facility. The MC was a Series 81000 motor controller manufactured by Siemens Industry Inc. that would serve a 600 hp submersible pump, operating on 3-phase, 4,160 volt electric power. The pump was to be installed in the well at the site. Employee #1 was a senior engineer working for the Siemens. He was the primary designer of the Series 81000 and had 20 years of experience with similar equipment. Employee #2 was a design engineer for Phasetronics LLC, which manufactured a motor starter that was incorporated in the Siemens motor controller starter system. Employee #3 was the sole proprietor of Scada & Control Systems LLC, which had purchased and provided the electronic and control systems equipment for the deep well and reservoir facility. Employee #1 and #2 arrived at the facility with Employee #3 earlier in the week to troubleshoot and repair the MC starter system, which had failed during initial testing in August 2012. The MC system was in a metal cabinet in one of two banks of cabinets that faced each other 6.58 ft apart inside the control building. The door of the MC cabinet was approximately 90 in. high and 36 in. wide. The interior of the cabinet was divided into three physically separate compartments from top to bottom with the 120 volt MC system control panel in the middle compartment. The bottom compartment contained various wiring, leads for the three phases of the pump motor and a movable carriage that held contactors, fuses and other circuit parts for the pump motor and the MC control panel. The carriage was 18 in. wide. It fit on a track on the right side of the bottom compartment and occupied slightly over half of the compartment's 35 in. interior width. It was racked (moved forward or back) by a lever next to the cabinet door on the lower right side. At its rearmost position, the contactors engaged the main busbar and energized the system at 4,160 volts. This was stepped down to 120 volts for the control panel. An interlock inside the cabinet was designed to accept a tab on the cabinet door so that the lever could not be moved to rack the contactors if the door were open. With the carriage removed from the cabinet and the system de-energized, Employee #1 installed a monitoring instrument behind the control panel and attached a cable from it to one of the motor leads at the left rear of the bottom section. He and Employee #3 then placed the contactor carriage back on its track. Employee #1 knelt on the concrete floor in front of the open cabinet and used a screwdriver to defeat the interlock. He told Employee #3 to slowly raise the lever to rack the contactor (which would engage the busbar) while he watched to see that the carriage did not pinch the instrument cable. Employee #2 stood a few feet away by the opposite bank of cabinets preparing a laptop computer to monitor the system test. None of them was wearing any form of electrical protective equipment, such as insulated gloves or gauntlets, face shield, or flame resistant clothing. After the contactor was racked, which energized the exposed parts on the carriage at 4,160 volts, Employee #1 said the cable "looked okay." As Employee #2 and #3 turned away, Employee #1 reached with his left arm into the cabinet and his forearm contacted one of the energized parts on the carriage. Employee #3 saw Employee #1's body shaking and tried to pull him away from the cabinet while he threw the lever to rack out the contactor. In the process, he received an electric shock. Employee #2 was also shocked when his left arm touched the open cabinet door as he also tried to pull Employee #1 away. Employee #2 threw the main breaker for the building, which was roughly 12 ft to the left of the MC cabinet. He and Employee #3 pulled Employee #1 out of the cabinet and onto hi

electrocution_fatal	On July 28, 2005, Employee #1, a versatile employee who did various jobs of Emerson Trailers, Incorporated, was welding trailer gates. He was welding using a Wire Feed, Arc Welding Machine. Employee #2 was in the room, but did not observe what happened. He stated he heard Employee #1 cry out. When he turned around, Employee #1 was on the floor. Other coworkers ran to see what happened and two coworkers started administering CPR. Emergency services arrived, took over CPR, and transported Employee #1 to the hospital, where he later died. An investigation into the incident found that the welding machine was in the "on" position, and that the 50 Amp electrical breaker, which served the circuit to the welding machine, had been tripped. It was noted that Employee #1 did not have his welding hood on. He did have his work gloves on, but the welding gun was not in his hand. The OSHA investigation revealed that the electrical conductors (2 hot and 1 neutral), inside of the male attachment plug for the welding machine, were not securely connected to their terminal points. The visible evidence of burns inside of the attachment plug and the melting of the individual strands of the neutral conductor indicated that the neutral conductor came out of its terminal point inside of the attachment plug and it made contact with a hot (energized) wire that was also inside of the attachment plug. This contact allowed current to flow through the neutral conductor and back down to the equipment grounding attachment location, which was on the metal frame inside of the welding machine. The frame of the welding machine became energized and so did any metal parts of the welding machine that were in contact with the metal frame. The welding machine was sitting on the floor next to a tin wall, when the incident occurred. There were two electrical burn marks on the tin wall, which matched up perfectly with two electrical burn marks that were on the side of the welding machine which was facing towards the tin wall. It was believed that Employee #1 made contact with the energized welding machine and he received an initial electrical shock. He either fell against the welding machine, causing it to hit the tin wall or both Employee #1 and the welding machine hit the tin wall. When the energized welding machine made contact with the tin wall an, electrical short circuit would have been created that would be sufficient to cause the fifty (50) Amp circuit breaker to trip out.

Coworker #1 went to get the project foreman, who called for emergency services. Emergency services arrived and conducted a rescue of Employee #1 from the trench. A rescue operation was deemed necessary, not because Employee #1 was trapped, but because the emergency responders did not want to risk causing further injury to Employee #1's back. Employee #1 then was transported to University Medical Center (UMC), Las Vegas, NV, where he was admitted, treated for bruises to his back, and discharged the same day. This incident was investigated by two Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) from Nevada OSHA. After arriving at the site at 1:45 p.m. on February 26, 2014 and following the Opening Conference, the CSHOs took photographs of the trench, the surrounding area, and the failed shoring. The CSHOs saw that the shoring that failed had a leak on one end of the cylinder. The employer's Safety Director stated he believed the shoring had failed in this area. The Trench Shoring Company was identified as the provider of the shoring. The employer's Safety Director stated that a representative of the Trench Shoring Company inspected the failed shoring and agreed that the seal in the cylinder failed. The employer was requested to provide documentation affirming this claim. On March 25, 2014, Nevada OSHA received a letter forwarded by the employer. The letter, from The Trench Shoring Company, stated that The Trench Shoring Company was not able to conclude what happened to the shoring. On March 14, 2014, two Nevada OSHA CSHOs returned to the site to obtain an air screening due to the high volume of vehicle traffic and heavy equipment operating in the area. The readings showed no signs of any elevated levels. The investigators made several attempts to contact and interview Employee #1, including a certified letter mailed March 17, 2014, but received no response. Therefore, on April 2, 2014, they proceeded to conduct a Closing Conference with the employer's Safety Director by phone.

electrocution_nonfatal	On September 26, 2002, Employee #1 was working with a VAC unit when, for an unknown reason, a nearby underground electrical line became grounded. The subsequent arc blast caught Employee #1 and threw him backwards. He was stunned but the arc blast didn't directly contact him and he suffered no serious injuries. He was transported to a local hospital, where he was treated and released. Subsequent investigation revealed that Employee #1 was using a Ring0Matic VAC machine to clean the dirt away from a buried power cable. It was manufactured in 2000 and was purchased as previously owned with 258 hours of use. His company had been hired to replace power lines in a substation complex due to the facility being modernized. The VAC unit was being used to accomplish the cleaning in locations known to hold underground utility cables. It uses water at 3,000 psi to break the dirt free and create a slurry which is then vacuumed by the unit. The system is contained on a trailer and contains its own water supply and catch tank. Personnel from the local power company, the owners of the cable, believe that there may have been a defect in the insulation of the cable. This allowed the water from the VAC unit to enter the power cable and create a grounded path, leading to the arc blast.

He and supervisory personnel later stated that he had not performed a potential test of the electrical current on the equipment and had not treated the system as energized. In addition, Employee #1 did not wear suitable personal protective equipment for working on energized equipment. A test on the energized equipment would have warned him of the potential current; approved insulated gloves and a flame-retardant top, would have protected him from an arc flash.

caught_nonfatal	At approximately 9:00 a.m. on July 8, 2013, Employee #1, with 4 Granite Inc., was attaching a light pole (14 ft tall and 2.5 in. in diameter) to a new guardrail that had been installed on top of a 13 in. high concrete curb. The light pole was a plastic pipe with two lights, 4 square ft, held 3 ft apart and angled out to a total width of about 76 ins. It weighed approximately 125 pounds, and its center of gravity was estimated to have been about 9.5 ft from the bottom. Two brackets made from angle iron had been welded to the guardrail. One bracket was at approximately 29 ins. above the ground, and the other was at approximately 53 ins. above the ground. Two holes were drilled into each bracket to accommodate a U-bolt to hold the light pole in place. Employee #1, and a coworker, lifted the light pole up into place, and Employee #1 installed the upper U-bolt. The bottom of the pole was on the outside of a piece of electrical conduit. The pole had to be lifted up over the conduit so the wiring could be attached. Employee #1's supervisor told Employee #1 and his coworker to wait while the supervisor got some wood blocks to rest the pole on, in order to raise the pole into the proper position before attaching the lower U-bolt. While the supervisor was gone, the coworker attempted to lift the light pole up and over the conduit, so that it would rest in between the conduit and the wall. The coworker used a 4 ft crowbar to lift the pole up at its base. The coworker held the pole with one hand and held the crowbar with the other. Employee #1 was reaching out over the coworker's shoulder to give him room to work and was holding the pole with one hand to steady it. Employee #1 did not have control of the pole. Each employee thought the other was in control of the top-heavy light pole. When the coworker pried the pole up, it rotated counter-clockwise around the upper bracket. Employee #1's right thumb was caught between the pole and the upper rail of the guardrail. Employee #1 suffered an avulsion (skin torn off to the skeleton) to the pad of his right thumb. He underwent surgery to amputate a portion of the right thumb. This accident was caused by the misjudgment of a hazardous situation, specifically, attempting to use a crowbar to lift a tall, top-heavy light pole. Secondary factors were poor body positioning for the task, and a lack of proper communication between Employee #1 and the coworker about who was supporting the pole.

electrocution_nonfatal	On June 23, 2003, Employee #1, a lineman, and three coworkers were placing new 12 kilovolt conductors on utility poles in Anaheim, CA. The existing equipment, which had 12 kilovolt circuits, needed to be reconfigured to accommodate the new conductors. Employee #1 was in an International bucket truck with a Versalift bucket assembly, while one of his coworkers, a fifth-stage apprentice, worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner, so the work involved moving the street side, neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole pin position. The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice connector sitting atop the insulator, so Employee #1 pulled off this connector and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the apprentice coworker to climb down, since this particular job was completed. The other coworkers, a groundman and the foreman, were also on the ground. Then, for some reason, the material handler load indicator contacted the energized phase, and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire, resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body, primarily his upper torso. Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed to be wearing rubber gloves, but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this was true.
